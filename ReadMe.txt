A java application that includes authorization and authentication. Users with "client" role in the database may view and buy games that are available in the database.
Whereas, users with the "admin" role may add, update, delete games/product from the database.

This application was made for educational purposes and was used for my Final exam as a 2nd year student.

Please use the following accounts saved on the database:

Role      Username          Password
Admin     Franchesca        franchesca
Admin     g                 g
Client    Aries             aries
Client    Myrna             myrna
Client    Mark              mark

disclaimer:
the idea of the application is to purchase games distributed by the administrator. However, this does not actually
implement any APIs to download the actual game.
